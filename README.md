Data is collect by remote sensing method and model is fed with the remote sensing data and data is analysed using Kearas python framework and the output is validated with geological mapping information if both attributes are true then the data is moved into the GIS database then further analysis is performed by model if the feedback obtained by the model is better then output is retrieved by the user if the feedback is negative then the model is again computed and check whether better results are obtained or not
